<h1>Car dashboard simulator</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a car dashboard simulator, which simulates various elements on the dashboard. These elements include fuel consumption based on engine RPM, different lights for brakes, indicators, headlights, engine temperature, and car heater effectiveness based on engine temperature. It also features a battery level simulation, where the battery charges when the engine is running and discharges based on the number of elements turned on with the engine off.
